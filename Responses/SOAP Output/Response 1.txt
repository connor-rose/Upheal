**Subjective:**

*   Patient states, "things are okay. This work is just insane right now." She expresses frustration with a coworker, Dave, who is not completing assigned tasks, which reflects poorly on her.
*   Patient acknowledges feeling "pissed off" with Dave but also notes that others seem "totally fine with it."
*   Patient acknowledges that she and her boyfriend get along, but reveals ongoing concerns, particularly when he "disappears sometimes, just for a few days and doesn't text or anything." She interprets this behavior as "childish."
*   Patient shares that her boyfriend cancelled on attending a close friend's wedding last minute.
*   Patient feels angry that he cancelled without an explanation or one that "felt valid," but ultimately felt "more just like hurt."
*   Patient states that she wants to be in a relationship where she can look after someone who is "aware of my feelings."
*   Patient verbalizes her desire to be in a long-term relationship that feels "full of love and full of taking care of each other" and that allows her to be "a little dependent on each other."
*   Patient states, "The hurtful part was like the fact that agency seemed like he really understood how much this meant to me."
*   Patient identifies that she wants someone who "comes home after a long day and if I'm feeling down... just like to know...and to tune into that."
*   Patient admits that she wants to get married and have kids and expresses frustration that things aren't happening the way that she wants.
*   Patient verbalizes a fear that she might not find someone and discusses the possibility of getting used to her boyfriend's "flakiness."
* Patient worries about dependency and becoming a "needy little girlfriend," as well as a fear that she is unable to let herself depend on Josh.
*   Patient acknowledges that she hasn't been "looked after in the way that I look after other people" and fears that it's already too late.

**Objective:**

*   The patient initially presents as anxious but speaks openly about her frustrations at work.
*   Patient smiles and laughs while discussing frustrating situations, suggesting a possible incongruence with her true feelings.
*   Patient's affect shifts and her speech slows down and becomes more serious when discussing her relationship and her boyfriend's behavior.
* Patient appears to make a deeper emotional connection to the session as she makes her thoughts and feelings more apparent.

**Assessment:**

*   The patient is experiencing stress and frustration related to work and her romantic relationship.
*   Her frustration at work seems to stem from a lack of responsibility and accountability from a coworker, which impacts her own performance and reputation.
*   Relationship issues appear to revolve around concerns about her boyfriend's lack of dependability, emotional unavailability, and communication style.
*   These issues evoke feelings of hurt, disappointment, and a sense of being alone or not prioritized in the relationship.
*   The patient seems to have a pattern of being a caretaker, both in her family and in her relationships, which may make it difficult for her to express her own needs and vulnerabilities. This also may create difficulty for her in trusting or allowing others to care for her.
*   These patterns could be rooted in conditions of worth, where the patient learned that it was not okay for her to feel certain emotions or have certain needs.
*   Biopsychosocial Model:
    *   Biological: No significant biological factors are apparent from the session.
    *   Psychological: Patient exhibits possible incongruence between expressed emotions and underlying feelings, difficulty expressing needs, and a tendency towards caretaking roles.
    *   Social: Patient's social environment includes workplace stressors and relationship dynamics that contribute to her distress.

**Plan:**

*   Continue exploring the patient's feelings related to her relationship, focusing on her disappointment, hurt, and unmet needs.
*   Encourage the patient to identify and challenge any conditions of worth that may be preventing her from expressing her needs and vulnerabilities.
*   Explore ways the patient can communicate her needs and feelings to her boyfriend more directly, while also addressing her fears about dependency and rejection.
*   If appropriate and desired, consider exploring the possibility of couples therapy to improve communication and understanding within the relationship.

Hallucination Check: Here's a breakdown of statements in the SOAP note that appear to be unsupported by the provided transcript:

*   **Subjective:**
    *   **"Patient admits that she wants to get married and have kids and expresses frustration that things aren't happening the way that she wants."** While she mentions wanting kids and being in a long-term relationship that feels like it is accommodating to that, she does not say she is frustrated with how long things are taking, or that things aren't happening the way she wants them to.
*   **Objective:**
    *   **"Patient appears to make a deeper emotional connection to the session as she makes her thoughts and feelings more apparent."** This is an interpretation. While the therapist in the transcript describes observing shifts and deepening, the statement about the patient "making her thoughts and feelings more apparent" is not explicitly stated in the transcript and may be an interpretation. The text supports, 'she's beginning, I think, to connect a bit with her feelings of her,' rather than her expressing them more explicitly or making them more apparent.
*   **Assessment:**
    *   **"These issues evoke feelings of hurt, disappointment, and a sense of being alone or not prioritized in the relationship."** The patient mentions feelings of hurt and disappointment, but she never explicitly says she is feeling "alone" or "not prioritized".
*   **Plan:**
    *   There are no unsupported statements in this section.

MSE: Okay, here's a Mental Status Exam (MSE) based on the provided SOAP note. Keep in mind that this is based on *limited* information, and a full MSE would typically involve more direct observation and questioning.

**Mental Status Examination**

**I. Appearance:**

*   Not explicitly described in the provided text.  In a real MSE, this would include observations about the patient's dress, hygiene, posture, and any notable physical characteristics.

**II. Behavior:**

*   Patient initially presents as anxious but speaks openly.
*   Smiles and laughs while discussing frustrating situations, suggesting possible incongruence between expressed emotions and underlying feelings.
*   Affect shifts and speech slows down when discussing relationship problems.
*   Appears to make a deeper emotional connection to the session as she verbalizes deeper thoughts and feelings.

**III. Speech:**

*   Speech initially normal in rate and tone.
*   Speech slows down and becomes more serious when discussing her relationship.

**IV. Mood:**

*   Reported Mood: "Okay" (initially), "Pissed off" (regarding coworker), "Hurt" (regarding boyfriend).  Expresses anger, frustration, and disappointment.

**V. Affect:**

*   Initially appears anxious, but overall, likely constricted to euthymic.
*   Possible incongruent affect (smiling/laughing when discussing frustrating situations).
*   Becomes more serious and possibly sadder/more vulnerable when discussing relationship issues.

**VI. Thought Process:**

*   Generally organized and goal-directed.  The patient is able to follow the line of questioning.
*   No evidence of loose associations, tangentiality, or flight of ideas detected based on the given information.

**VII. Thought Content:**

*   Preoccupations: Work-related stress (coworker issues), relationship difficulties (boyfriend's behavior, fear of not finding a suitable partner, desire for marriage and children).
*   No evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideation, delusions, or hallucinations reported in the text.

**VIII. Perceptions:**

*   No evidence of hallucinations, illusions, or other perceptual disturbances reported in the text.

**IX. Cognition:**

*   Not formally assessed in the provided text. A full MSE would include assessments of:
    *   **Orientation:** (to person, place, time, situation) - Not specified, presumably intact.
    *   **Attention/Concentration:** (e.g., digit span, serial 7s) - Not assessed.
    *   **Memory:** (recent and remote) - Not assessed.
    *   **Fund of Knowledge:** (general information) - Not assessed.
    *   **Abstraction:** (e.g., interpreting proverbs) - Not assessed.

**X. Insight:**

*   Fair. The patient acknowledges her feelings and is able to identify patterns in her relationships and potential areas of concern (e.g., dependency fears).
*   Demonstrates some awareness of her own needs and desires.

**XI. Judgment:**

*   Likely intact, but difficult to fully assess without more information.  The patient is generally able to recognize potential consequences.

**Summary:**

This is a female patient who presents with anxious features, and demonstrates a euthymic mood with a slightly constricted and possibly incongruent affect. Her thought processes are organized, and her thought content is focused on work-related stress and relationship difficulties. She demonstrates a fair degree of insight into her situation and potential issues. Further assessment of cognitive functioning would be beneficial.

Risk Level:  Okay, based on the provided Mental Status Exam and the associated information, here's an assessment of suicide and homicide risk levels:

**Suicide Risk:**

*   **Risk Level: Low.**

*   **Rationale:** The MSE indicates **no evidence of suicidal ideation** reported in the text. There are no reported thoughts of self-harm, wishing to be dead, or any suicidal plans. While the patient is experiencing relationship difficulties and expressing feelings of hurt, these stressors do not appear to be manifesting as suicidal thoughts.

**Homicide Risk:**

*   **Risk Level: Negligible/Absent**

*   **Rationale:** The MSE indicates **no evidence of homicidal ideation** reported in the text. There's no mention of anger directed towards others to the point of wanting to harm them, or any thoughts, plans, or intentions related to harming anyone. The patient's focus is primarily on her own distress and relationship issues.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **This assessment is based on limited information.** A more thorough risk assessment would require direct questioning about suicidal and homicidal thoughts, intentions, plans, and access to means.
*   **Risk can change.** Even if the patient is currently at low risk, her situation should be monitored, and she should be encouraged to seek support if her symptoms worsen.
*   **Clinical Judgment is Essential:** The information provided is only a snapshot. The clinician must use their professional judgment, based on their interaction with the patient and a more comprehensive assessment, to make a final determination of risk. If the clinician has any concerns, they should err on the side of caution and conduct a more in-depth assessment.


Evaluating SOAP Note Clinically...

Okay, here's an evaluation of the SOAP note based on the provided rubric:

| Category      | Score | Explanation                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subjective** | 2     | The subjective section is thorough, capturing the patient's feelings, thoughts, and concerns in her own words and providing good context. |
| **Objective**  | 2     | The objective section includes relevant observations about the patient's presentation, affect, and behavior during the session.            |
| **Assessment** | 2     | The assessment section accurately synthesizes the subjective and objective information, offering clinically sound interpretations and a biopsychosocial formulation.     |
| **Plan**       | 2     | The plan is well-defined, providing concrete steps for future sessions that are consistent with the assessment and the patient's goals.   |

**Final Score: 8/8**

This clinician demonstrates strong documentation skills, providing a comprehensive and well-articulated SOAP note that reflects a sound understanding of the patient's presenting issues and a clear plan for treatment.
