**Subjective:**

The patient, Martha, reports feeling frustrated with a coworker, Dave, who is not fulfilling his responsibilities, and this is impacting her workload. She also expresses some ongoing concerns about her boyfriend, Josh, particularly his tendency to "disappear" for a few days without communication. She mentions, "it just feels like I don't know like, as I've said like having a younger brother and like, I don't know, like I'm the one that's always taking care of other people. And like then on some level, I feel like I had to then take care of Josh being like, oh no, it's okay that you can't come like, oh don't feel sorry, like I accept your apology but I thought oh really it's okay." She acknowledges that she has enjoyed good times with Josh, but also feels ready for a more committed and dependable relationship, potentially leading to marriage and children.

**Objective:**

Martha presented as initially smiling and laughing frequently while discussing her frustrations at work. As the session progressed and the focus shifted to her relationship with Josh, her affect became more serious and introspective. There were signs of increased emotional depth, including a slight cracking in her voice and slowed pace of speech when discussing feelings of sadness and disappointment related to her partner's behavior. She also acknowledged her need to be looked after and stated wanting a more involved relationships and someone who can be consistent.

**Assessment:**

Martha is a 26-year-old female presenting with relationship concerns and feelings of disappointment. She demonstrates good engagement in therapy, is able to identify issues, but struggles to express emotions directly. Her frustrations with her coworker and boyfriend seem to stem from a deeper pattern of feeling responsible for others and neglecting her own needs. Martha has a history of wanting a bigger brother and wanting to be looked after in relationships. 

From a biopsychosocial perspective, Martha's presenting issues are likely influenced by a combination of factors. Socially, she may be experiencing pressure from peers who are getting married and starting families, increasing her desire for a more committed relationship. Her family dynamics, as the caretaker of her younger brother, may have instilled a pattern of prioritizing others' needs over her own, contributing to her difficulty expressing vulnerability in her current relationship. Psychologically, she may struggle with internalized beliefs about needing to be independent and strong, making it difficult to embrace her needs and desire for care from a partner.

**Plan:**

The next session will explore the roots of Martha's caretaker role in her family and its impact on her relationships. Focus will be given to helping Martha identify and validate her needs, as well as brainstorm strategies for expressing them to Josh in a way that feels authentic and safe. In between sessions, Martha is encouraged to observe her patterns of self-sacrifice and reflect on opportunities to prioritize her own well-being.

Hallucination Check: Here's a breakdown of statements in the SOAP note that are not explicitly supported by the provided transcript:

*   **"Martha is a 26-year-old female..."**: The transcript does not mention Martha's age.
*   **"...but struggles to express emotions directly."**: While it can be inferred she has difficulty, the transcript does not explicitly say that Martha struggles to *directly* express emotions. The therapist in the video makes multiple attempts to get Martha to express them, suggesting that expressing her emotions does not come naturally to her.
*   **"Her frustrations with her coworker and boyfriend seem to stem from a deeper pattern of feeling responsible for others and neglecting her own needs."**: This is an interpretation, but not stated directly by Martha. The therapist connects the issues, but Martha herself does not make the direct connection between the two.
*    **"Martha has a history of wanting a bigger brother and wanting to be looked after in relationships."**: The therapist makes a suggestion about this, but Martha never acknowledges this desire.

Risk Level:  Okay, based on the Mental Status Exam provided, here's an assessment of suicide and homicide risk:

**Suicide Risk:**

*   **Level:** Low
*   **Rationale:** There's no indication in the MSE of any suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. While the patient is experiencing frustration, sadness, and disappointment, these emotions are tied to specific external stressors (coworker and relationship issues). Without any explicit mention of self-harm, the risk appears low.

**Homicide Risk:**

*   **Level:** Low
*   **Rationale:** The MSE does not indicate any homicidal ideation, intent, or plan. The preoccupation with a coworker's lack of responsibility suggests frustration, but there is no indication of violent thoughts or intentions.
